## SQL for Data Analysis

This GitHub repository is dedicated to a comprehensive exploration of SQL for data analysis using the Parch and Posey database. This database is a hypothetical sales data repository for a paper company, encompassing various paper types such as standard, gloss, and poster.

### Database Structure
The database is organised into several tables, interconnected through a well-defined database schema. These tables contain critical sales-related information, which we will leverage to demonstrate SQL concepts, from fundamental to advanced.

### Project Content
In this repository, you will find:

SQL Queries: A collection of SQL queries and scripts showcasing various data analysis tasks using the Parch and Posey database.

Documentation: Detailed explanations, comments, and annotations to help you understand the SQL code and its functionality.

Sample Reports: Sample reports generated from the SQL queries illustrate real-world applications of SQL for data analysis.

Feel free to explore the project, run the SQL queries, and adapt them to your specific data analysis needs. This repository is a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their SQL skills and apply them to practical scenarios. 

Enjoy your SQL journey with Parch and Posey!
