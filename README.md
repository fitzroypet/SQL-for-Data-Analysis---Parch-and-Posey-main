## SQL for Data Analysis

In this project, I used Parch and Posey database to explore different functional aspects of SQL, from basic to advanced.

Parch and Posey are a hypothetical paper company's sales data for different types of paper (standard, gloss, and poster). 

The database consists of different tables linked to a database schema.
